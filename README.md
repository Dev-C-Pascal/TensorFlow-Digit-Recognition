# Digit Recognition Project

## Overview

Machine learning project which used PyTorch library for training convolutional neural network (CNN) and matplotlib for visualization. 

## Quick Start

To quickly clone and run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dev-C-Pascal/TensorFlow-Digit-Recognition.git
    ```

2. **Necessary Libraries**

    Install the required Python packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip3 install torch torchvision matplotlib
    ```
3. **In Jupiter Ntebook**
